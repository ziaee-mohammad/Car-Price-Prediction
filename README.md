🏎 Car Price Prediction

📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting car prices using the Auto Scout dataset.
Through comprehensive data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning modeling, it explores the relationships between various car features and their corresponding market prices.

The project compares Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression models to identify the best-performing one for price prediction.

📊 Key Steps

1. Data Exploration (EDA) – Handling missing values, correlation analysis, and visual insights.


2. Feature Engineering – Encoding categorical features and scaling numerical data.


3. Model Training – Training and tuning multiple regression models.


4. Performance Evaluation – Comparing metrics (R², MAE, RMSE) across all models.


5. Model Selection – Selecting the most accurate and generalizable model.
